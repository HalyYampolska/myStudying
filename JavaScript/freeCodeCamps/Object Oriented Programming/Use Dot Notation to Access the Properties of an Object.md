# Introduction

The last challenge created an object with various properties. Now you'll see how to access the values of those properties. Here's an example:
```javascript
let duck = {
  name: "Aflac",
  numLegs: 2
};
console.log(duck.name);
```
Dot notation is used on the object name, `duck`, followed by the `name` of the property, name, to access the value of `Aflac`.

## Task 
Print both properties of the `dog` object to your console.

## Before

```javascript
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Only change code below this line
```

## After

```javascript
let dog = {
  name: "Spot",
  numLegs: 4
};
// Only change code below this line
console.log(dog.name);
console.log(dog.numLegs);
```
