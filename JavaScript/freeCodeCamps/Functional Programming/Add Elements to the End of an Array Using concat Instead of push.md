# Introduction

Functional programming is all about creating and using non-mutating functions.

The last challenge introduced the `concat` method as a way to merge arrays into a new array without mutating the original arrays. Compare `concat` to the `push` method. `push` adds items to the end of the same array it is called on, which mutates that array. Here's an example:
```javascript
const arr = [1, 2, 3];
arr.push(4, 5, 6);
```
`arr` would have a modified value of `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]`, which is not the functional programming way.

`concat` offers a way to merge new items to the end of an array without any mutating side effects.


## Task 

Change the `nonMutatingPush` function so it uses concat to merge `newItem` to the end of original without mutating original or `newItem` arrays. The function should return an array.

## Before

```javascript
function nonMutatingPush(original, newItem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return original.push(newItem);

  // Only change code above this line
}

const first = [1, 2, 3];
const second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingPush(first, second);
```

## After

```javascript
function nonMutatingPush(original, newItem) {
  // Only change code below this line
  return original.concat(newItem);

  // Only change code above this line
}

const first = [1, 2, 3];
const second = [4, 5];
nonMutatingPush(first, second);
```
