# Introduction

Another data type is the Boolean. Booleans may only be one of two values: `true` or `false`. They are basically little on-off switches, where `true` is on and `false` is off. These two states are mutually exclusive.
! values are never written with quotes. The strings `"true"` and `"false"` are not Boolean and have no special meaning in JavaScript.

## Before

Modify the `welcomeToBooleans` function so that it returns `true` instead of `false` when the run button is clicked.

```javascript

function welcomeToBooleans() {
  // Only change code below this line

  return false; // Change this line

  // Only change code above this line
}

```

## Answer

```javascript

function welcomeToBooleans() {
  // Only change code below this line

  return true; // Change this line

  // Only change code above this line
}

```
